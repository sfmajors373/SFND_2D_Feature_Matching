The empirical record of this assignment can be found in './MP 7 8 9.pdf' but here I will note the neighborhood sizes.  Shi-Tomasi had a large spread of points around the image, while the Harris detector had very few points at all.  Fast had a lot of points and seemed to catch lines like along the bridge or the running board of the car to the left really well..  The brisk keypoints were very large and I question to what degree those would be useful enough to accurately track the preceeding vehicle.  There were fewer orb points, but they were quite large.  Akaze keypoints were not as small as Shi-Tomasi or fast, but were much more reasonable than orb and brisk.  Sift has a wide ranfe of keypoints with some being quite small to some that are quite large.
